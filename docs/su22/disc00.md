## Icebreaker

- Introduce different people in groups of (roughly) four!
- Sample Questions:
    - Name & Pronouns (if you want)
    - Grade & Major
    - Hobbies
- As a group, try to find as many things that everyone in your group has in common (cannot be related to college or classes; I know you're all taking 61a at berkeley :))

# Lost On the Moon 

Your spaceship has just crashed on the moon. You were scheduled to rendezvous with a mother ship 200 miles away on the lighted surface of the moon, but the rough landing has ruined your ship and destroyed all the equipment on board except for the 15 items listed below. Your crewâ€™s survival depends on reaching the mother ship, so you must choose the most critical items available for the 200-mile trip. 

Your task is to rank the 15 items in terms of their importance for survival. Place a number 1 by the most important item, number 2 by the second most important, and so on, through number 15, the least important.

- 5 min by yourself
- 10 min in groups of 4
